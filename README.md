# odin-recipes

Hello everyone! Welcome to my first ever TOP project! Today, I will be creating a simple recipes website (please do not use any of the actual recipes on this website because they are NOT REAL, the descriptions are only written for the purpose of demonstrating my HTML skills thus far; Additionally, none of the information included in this project is in any way meant to discredit or harm the Odin Project and is merely a representation of my work) using the basic HTML knowledge that I have learned about thus far. After the project is completed, I should have been able to demonstrate my skills in applying the following: proper HTML boilerplate code, use of headings and paragraphs, bold and italic text, links and images, lists, ability to commmit on the command line, and much more! With that said, thank you for viewing my repo and enjoy the project!

Update:
Hello everyone! Welcome back to the repo! I just through the first two lessons of CSS Foundations, and so I've come back to demonstrate my skills and knowledge of what I've learned thus far. After the completion of this project, I should have been able to demonstrate my skills in applying the following: use of a multitude of selectors (type, class, ID, etc), connecting of said selectors (grouping, chaining, etc), use of combinators (descendant combinator), use of different properties, use of the cascade (specificity, rule order, etc), and much more! And with that, thank you for once again coming back to the repo and enjoy the project!
